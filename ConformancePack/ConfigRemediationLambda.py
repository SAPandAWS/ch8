# This code assumes that the Lambda function is triggered by AWS Config and that the event passed to the function contains all necessary information
# This remediation function assumes that the Lambda has the necessary permissions to stop, modify, and start EC2 instances. 
# It's also simplified for brevity. Error handling, logging, and dealing with instances that can't be stopped or modified should be implemented for production use
